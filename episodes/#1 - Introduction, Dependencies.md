Welcome to the first Spring Boot GraphQL tutorial! 

In this episode I explain the core dependencies and libraries used throughout the 
series and show you a basic get-started Intellij setup example.

In this series I depend on graphql-spring-boot, which depends on graphql-java-tools 
and graphql-java. For a basic graphql server we only are required to depend on 
graphql-spring boot, and have the spring boot parent pom.

I also include some common maven plugins for development, such as maven-compiler-plugin 
and maven-pmd-plugin.

See you in part 2! Creating your first graphql schema.
